    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We at Tappsi use Airbrake for reporting errors from our Rails API. Airbrake provides an integration mechanism via webhooks for dealing with the errors reported by the platform, the developer only has to expose an endpoint to be consumed by Airbrake, where the error messages will be sent.</p>

<p>This is a very common need, so we decided to implement a microservice for it that can be reused by other projects. We chose to write it in Go to show the usage of several high-performance Go libraries and frameworks, and to demonstrate how to send messages to a RabbitMQ exchange using a connection pool.</p>

<p>Our Airbrake webhook has been deployed in production for the past 6 months at the time of writing, working without a hitch. The best part is that this is an open source project! Feel free to download and use it in your own applications:</p>
