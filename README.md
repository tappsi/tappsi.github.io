## Add a new blog entry

In order to add a new blog entry, given that you already installed jekyll go to your
`tappsi.github.io` and add to the folder `_posts` a new file with the date as a prefix
and the name you prefer, for instance the first post was named `2015-08-20-hello-world.markdown`

Use a front matter like

```
---
layout: post
title:  "My awesome post"
date:   2015-08-20 19:09:52
tags: tappsi english
comments: true
author_name: Super hacker
author_github: your githubname
---
```

If you want to use a trick that someone earlier used, feel free to dig in a previous post.

## Publish your entry

just push in the repo

## Style and format

Always make sure you are the author of your entry, it's okay to have your post in spanish
and is awesome to have it in english, don't worry if it looks mixed, you will be able to
have things viewed by some millions in spanish but billions in english.

Have fun and keep hacking
